<h1>🃏Poker Simulator🃏</h1>
<b>
  My friends and I have gotten really into Texas Hold'em Poker recently
  <br/> One of the things we like to do while we wait for everyone to arrive is play our favorite hands with no betting, leaving the winner all up to chance
  <br/> This Poker Simulator aims to replicate that
</b>
<h2> How it Works</h2>
<b>
  1. The user chooses the amount of players that are in the game. Each player is dealt 2 unique cards
  <br/> 2. The code shows the community cards
  <br/> 3. The winner is calculated and shown, and the user can choose to keep playing or quit
</b>

<h2> Code </h2>
<h3> Card Class</h3>

![Card Class](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4b9e723-2bba-4e62-b899-b7fdfc47d530)
<br/>I made a card parent class and child classes for each card value in a 52 card deck
